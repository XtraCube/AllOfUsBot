# AllOfUsBot
A simplified version of the All of Us Plugin for Impostor v1.2.2-123. This plugin adds some useful commands(chart below) to the chat system. It is also a replacement for memory editing when using a supported 100 Player Mod(see below)

# 100 Player Capabilities
The plugin has two commands designed to be used with a valid 100 Player Mod, `/playerlimit` and `/implimit`.
Currently, these are the supported mods:
- All Of Us Mod: https://discord.gg/hMHrKGAtKq
- Crowded Mod: https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod

# Commands
This version of the plugin has some useful commands, but it won't contain as much as the official All of Us server plugin
| Command  | Description | Value Types | Usage |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| /help  | tells you the name of every command  | N/A  |  /help |
| /map  | Allows you to change the map  | Skeld, MiraHQ or Polus  |  /map Skeld |
| /name  | Allows you to change your name  | Any valid Among Us name  |  /name XtraCube |
| /color  | Allows you to change your color  | Any Among Us color  |  /color black |
| /playerlimit  | Changes the playerlimit. For use with All Of Us Mod or Crowded Mod  | Any integer between 4 and 127  |  /playerlimit 100 |
| /implimit  | Changes the impostor limit. For use with All Of Us Mod or Crowded Mod  | Any integer between 1 and 63*  |  /implimit 5 |

\*The command checks if the impostor limit you entered is less than half the player limit to prevent instant wins for impostor. </font>
